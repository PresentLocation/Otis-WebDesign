#### Otis Web Design

Otis Web Design is a four-course curriculum that guides the artist through fundamental techniques and practices essential for creative design and development of web experiences.

The curriculum was developed, designed and, taught by Eugene Ahn at Otis College of Art and Design.

The code resources developed for this curriculum have been absorbed into the Code Your Heart Out project at http://www.codeyourheartout.com. All repositories have been relocated in support of that project.
